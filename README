== Getting Started

After cloning or performing a pull, run "bundle install" to ensure you have the latest gems listed in the Gemfile used in the project.  This should download and install the gems listed from the "source" gem repository listed at the top.

I've added two models for initial rails3/couchdb testing: Contact and Address (maybe a rename later).  Once you've updated, run the command "rails console" to load up the development environment in an irb console.  This will allow you to play around with your models in a scripting type environment.  Type "exit" to quit the irb console.  Test out the couchdb functionality using the following irb commands:

Make sure you start CouchDBX and have a database created and named "skillsdatabase".  This is defined in the Contact.rb model file.  This should eventually be refactored into a base model class.

--------------------- within irb console
puts "You have #{Contact.all.size} contacts"
# => You have 0 contacts

todd = Contact.new(:first_name => 'Todd', :last_name => 'Matthews')

# just showing you can edit the instance after creating it
todd.company_name = 'Razorfish'

# assigning a new address to our contact
todd.address = Address.new(:line_1 => '730 Peachtree St.', :city => 'Atlanta', :state => 'GA')

# We could have also assign each value separately like that:
todd.address.zip_code = 30308

puts "new contact to add: #{todd.inspect}"
# => new contact to add: {"updated_at"=>nil, "company_name"=>"m|a agile", "first_name"=>"Todd", "couchrest-type"=>"Contact", "address"=>{"city"=>"Atlanta", "zip_code"=>30308, "line_1"=>"730 Peachtree St.", "state"=>"GA"}, "last_name"=>"Matthews", "created_at"=>nil}

# let's save this contact into couchdb
todd.save

puts "You now have #{Contact.all.size} contact(s)"
# => You now have 1 contact(s)

# let's reload the objects from the database
todd_from_db = Contact.first

puts todd_from_db.inspect
# => {"updated_at"=>Sat Oct 30 1:52:01 -0700 2010, "company_name"=>"Razorfish", "_id"=>"749a89203d5cb217d18295d416f9fb2b", "_rev"=>"1-2705668756", "first_name"=>"Todd", "couchrest-type"=>"Contact", "address"=>{"city"=>"Atlanta, "zip_code"=>30308, "line_1"=>"730 Peachtree St.", "state"=>"GA"}, "last_name"=>"Matthews", "created_at"=>Sat Oct 30 1:52:01 -0700 2010}

# let's just output the address to see if it works as expected
puts todd_from_db.address
# => 730 Peachtree St.
# => Atlanta, GA 30308

# let's delete the DB since it was just a test
DB.delete!
